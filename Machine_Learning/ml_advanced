This will take you through some useful commands that we will need for building, running, and comparing our ML models.

CUDA: PyTorch makes it easy to compute operations using the GPU. This helps with speed, as GPUs are designed to perform 
parallel computations, which can lead to a significant speedup in the training of machine learning models. It also helps 
with memory and power. 

if torch.cuda.is_available():
  print('You have the GPU available!\n')
  device = 'cuda:0'
